							<p>	Of course, we’re still a café, so while your gaming, why not partake of our wide array of drinks and snacks? There’s classics like Monster, Mtn Dew, Pepperoni, or more café-based items such as Cappuccinos, Banana muffins, and if your over 18 and want a pick me up, Irish and Bailey’s coffees.
								Or perhaps you want those things without the Coffee? Or you want a beer, cider, or other spirits? Don’t worry, we’ve perhaps the widest array of spirits you’ll see outside of a hipster bar or a Tesco, from the every-bar spirits such as whiskey and vodka, to drinks from far away foreign lands, such as Aldi’s stores own brand beer that tastes surprisingly good, Nepalese Raski, Indian Arrack, the drink of the East India Company! Fijian kava, strong enough to comfortably numb your tongue, drunk from coconut halves to recreate that Pacific paradise feel, or perhaps you want something colder? Fjallagrasa moss schnapps, scientists have discovered the lichen and moss used in its distilling has immune stimulating properties, which means when you find yourself with a cold, chugging a bottle of this is simply taking your medicine! For those of you with a sweet tooth as big as mine, Poire Williams clear brandy from France and Switzerland is tied in place with a budding pear inside it, allowing the fruit to grow inside of the bottle, its sweetness giving lend to a sweet drink that you will end up drinking too much of. Whatever it is that takes your fancy, we probably stock it, and if we don’t, please request it from a member of staff, and we’ll try to have it in stock for you as soon as possible!</p>
