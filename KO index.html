    <p>What is the difference between a traditional cafe and the KDR? Why our wide array of Games consoles and PCs, like the arcades of old, videogames no longer must be played in isolation, or over a virtual voicechat, but side by side with strangers or with friends, just as your parents did when they where younger.
    A 50” screen is the lowest requirement for us, tournaments, local DJs, an atmosphere which seems to result in you winning a few more matches than you normally do, and people who already hold a similar interest to you, one more game isn’t a guilty justification to stay up, its practically our motto!
    Birthdays, private events, tournaments and even special Virtual reality rooms are all easy to set up, all you need to do is call us, we also have our own brand of gaming chairs, and do customised controllers, choose from a wide array or already existing templates, or design your own from scratch!
    </p>

    <p>If you want to try build your own PC, we have practically exclusive stock, from the latest and greatest of high-end specs, to more affordable middle of the road everyday PCs that can still comfortably run most modern games. But what if you can’t build your own PC? Well, you needn’t worry, because we offer an exclusive 2-day course which will have you building like Ian “8pack” perry! You’ll even have a choice of Operating Systems, Windows 7, Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, or Linux, if your unsure which, our in-house software engineers will break down and explain the pros and cons of each one, free of charge.
    Or maybe you want to buy a PC premade? We cover all ranges, from €140 MacBook’s to the 8Pack OrionX, ever seen a PC that cost more then the deposit for a family home? Well, now you have!
    </p>

    <p>Of course, we’re still a café, so while your gaming, why not partake of our wide array of drinks and snacks? There’s classics like Monster, Mtn Dew, Pepperoni, or more café based items such as Cappochinos, Banana muffins, and if your over 18 and want a pick me up, Irish and Bailey’s coffees.
    Or perhaps you want those things without the Coffee? Or you want a beer, cider, or other spirits? Don’t worry, we’ve perhaps the widest array of spirits you’ll see outside of a hipster bar or a Tesco, from the every-bar spirits such as whiskey and vodka, to drinks from far away foreign lands, such as Aldi’s stores own brand beer that tastes surprisingly good, Nepalese Raski, Indian Arrack, the drink of the East India Company solider! Fijian kava, strong enough to comfortably numb your tongue, drunk from coconut halves to recreate that Pacific paradise feel, or perhaps you want something colder? Fjallagrasa moss schnapps, scientists have discovered the lichen and moss used in its distilling has immune stimulating properties, which means when you find yourself with a cold, chugging a bottle of this is simply taking your medicine! For those of you with a sweet tooth as big as mine, Poire Williams clear brandy from France and Switzerland is tied in place with a budding pear inside it, allowing the fruit to grow inside of the bottle, its sweetness giving lend to a sweet drink that you definitely will end up drinking too much of
